# Everything Claude Code

**The complete collection of Claude Code configs from an Anthropic hackathon winner.**

Production-ready agents, skills, hooks, commands, rules, and MCP configurations evolved over 10+ months of intensive daily use building real products.

## The Guides

This repo is the raw code only. The guides explain everything.

### Start Here: The Shorthand Guide

<img width="592" height="445" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a471488-59cc-425b-8345-5245c7efbcef" />

**[The Shorthand Guide to Everything Claude Code](https://x.com/affaanmustafa/status/2012378465664745795)**

The foundation - what each config type does, how to structure your setup, context window management, and the philosophy behind these configs. **Read this first.**

### Then: The Longform Guide

<img width="609" height="428" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9ca43bc-b149-427f-b551-af6840c368f0" />

**[The Longform Guide to Everything Claude Code](https://x.com/affaanmustafa/status/2014040193557471352)**

The advanced techniques - token optimization, memory persistence across sessions, verification loops & evals, parallelization strategies, subagent orchestration, and continuous learning. Everything in this guide has working code in this repo.

| Topic | What You'll Learn |
|-------|-------------------|
| Token Optimization | Model selection, system prompt slimming, background processes |
| Memory Persistence | Hooks that save/load context across sessions automatically |
| Continuous Learning | Auto-extract patterns from sessions into reusable skills |
| Verification Loops | Checkpoint vs continuous evals, grader types, pass@k metrics |
| Parallelization | Git worktrees, cascade method, when to scale instances |
| Subagent Orchestration | The context problem, iterative retrieval pattern |

## Installation

### Option 1: Install as Plugin (Recommended)

The easiest way to use this repo - install as a Claude Code plugin:

```bash
# Add this repo as a marketplace
/plugin marketplace add affaan-m/everything-claude-code

# Install the plugin
/plugin install everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code
```

Or add directly to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "everything-claude-code": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "affaan-m/everything-claude-code"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "everything-claude-code@everything-claude-code": true
  }
}
```

This gives you instant access to all commands, agents, skills, and hooks.

---

### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer manual control over what's installed:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code.git

# Copy agents to your Claude config
cp everything-claude-code/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Copy rules
cp everything-claude-code/rules/*.md ~/.claude/rules/

# Copy commands
cp everything-claude-code/commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/

# Copy skills
cp -r everything-claude-code/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

#### Add hooks to settings.json

Copy the hooks from `hooks/hooks.json` to your `~/.claude/settings.json`.

#### Configure MCPs

Copy desired MCP servers from `mcp-configs/mcp-servers.json` to your `~/.claude.json`.

**Important:** Replace `YOUR_*_HERE` placeholders with your actual API keys.

### Read the Guides

Seriously, read the guides. These configs make 10x more sense with context.

1. **[Shorthand Guide](https://x.com/affaanmustafa/status/2012378465664745795)** - Setup and foundations
2. **[Longform Guide](https://x.com/affaanmustafa/status/2014040193557471352)** - Advanced techniques (token optimization, memory persistence, evals, parallelization)

---

## Key Concepts

### Agents

Subagents handle delegated tasks with limited scope. Example:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
model: opus
---

You are a senior code reviewer...
```

### Skills

Skills are workflow definitions invoked by commands or agents:

```markdown
# TDD Workflow

1. Define interfaces first
2. Write failing tests (RED)
3. Implement minimal code (GREEN)
4. Refactor (IMPROVE)
5. Verify 80%+ coverage
```

### Hooks

Hooks fire on tool events. Example - warn about console.log:

```json
{
  "matcher": "tool == \"Edit\" && tool_input.file_path matches \"\\\\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$\"",
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "#!/bin/bash\ngrep -n 'console\\.log' \"$file_path\" && echo '[Hook] Remove console.log' >&2"
  }]
}
```

### Rules

Rules are always-follow guidelines. Keep them modular:

```
~/.claude/rules/
  security.md      # No hardcoded secrets
  coding-style.md  # Immutability, file limits
  testing.md       # TDD, coverage requirements
```

## Contributing

**Contributions are welcome and encouraged.**

This repo is meant to be a community resource. If you have:
- Useful agents or skills
- Clever hooks
- Better MCP configurations
- Improved rules

Please contribute! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

### Ideas for Contributions

- Language-specific skills (Python, Go, Rust patterns)
- Framework-specific configs (Django, Rails, Laravel)
- DevOps agents (Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS)
- Testing strategies (different frameworks)
- Domain-specific knowledge (ML, data engineering, mobile)

---

## Background

I've been using Claude Code since the experimental rollout. Won the Anthropic x Forum Ventures hackathon in Sep 2025 building [zenith.chat](https://zenith.chat) with [@DRodriguezFX](https://x.com/DRodriguezFX) - entirely using Claude Code.

These configs are battle-tested across multiple production applications.

---

## Important Notes

### Context Window Management

**Critical:** Don't enable all MCPs at once. Your 200k context window can shrink to 70k with too many tools enabled.

Rule of thumb:
- Have 20-30 MCPs configured
- Keep under 10 enabled per project
- Under 80 tools active

Use `disabledMcpServers` in project config to disable unused ones.

### Customization

These configs work for my workflow. You should:
1. Start with what resonates
2. Modify for your stack
3. Remove what you don't use
4. Add your own patterns
